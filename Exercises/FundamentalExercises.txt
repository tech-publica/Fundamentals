1) Create an array of 100 ints which are the first 100 multiples of 3
Calculate the sum and average (mean value) of this numbers
2) Write a console app that asks the user to enter 3 lines of text (which can have spaces).
Find out and print the number of words in those 3 lines of text, and the average number of chars in a word
(Advanced) Find our the mode of the lenght of the words. THe mode of a distribution is the value that appears more times
3) Create a void function which receives an integer and doubles it. Verify that when you call the funtion the original integer 
does not change. Try againg with a void function which takes an integer REF parameters. Verify that this time you are changing
the original value.
4) Write a console app which asks the user to guess a number between 0 and 100
When it receives the input using the Console.ReadLine funtion it will have to transform the input string into a number.
Do the transformation with the method Int32.TryParse and understand how this method uses an output parameter
If the number input by the user is lower than the guess print "lower", if it is higher print "higher",
if it is the right number print a congratulation message and terminate the program
5) Write a class to represent a Bank Account. The bank account will have a balance of type decimal,
a method to deposit a decimal amount, a method to withdraw a decimal amount, and a final one to transfer a decimal amount to 
another bank account. Wihdraw and transfer should execute only if the balance is greater or equal of the sum that we are trying
